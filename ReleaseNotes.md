# Release notes

## v2.0.0 - 2017-07-xx
- **[New]:** Since Newtonsoft JSON.Net went from maintaining the JSON Schema validation in the MIT licensed JSON.Net lib and instead started to maintain that in a separate distribution JSON.Net Schema which has another license and requires a commercial license, Requester.Validation now uses [NJsonSchema](https://github.com/RSuter/NJsonSchema) which is MIT licensed.
- **[New]**: Requester and Requester.Validation now targets .NET Standard.
